Dev-Engine is a multi-user blog platform. Anyone can create an account and post blogs on this platform. The email verification process added to the system to make sure the user is somewhat real and not spam. Users can create blogs, categories & tags as they prefer. The rich text editor has (react-quill) added to the system to give users maximum user experience. Users can take any amount of time to write a blog post (e.g., days or weeks) because all the details will persist in the browser's local storage until the user published the blog post to the public.

## Technologies

> Used next.js with MERN technologies to  generate dynamic, server-rendered (i.e., pre-rendered) blog posts that ensure better SEO and user
experience.
